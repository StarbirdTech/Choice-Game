# Choice Game

This project teaches society about themselves and governance. Players begin by completing a variety of simple tasks, such as organizing shapes, dragging sliders, and clicking buttons. The data generated by the player's actions is then visualized and can be manipulated and experimented with by applying different methods of ranking and sorting data seen in real world elections. This will allow everyone to experiment with data in fun and meaningful ways while coming to their own conclusions about the best methods to apply to governments.

## Game Flow
* Do a bunch of random tasks
* See how other people did the tasks
* Apply different voting methods to the data
* See connections between different choices (ex. If you click the red button you are most likely to drag the slider to the left)

## Why have users generate their own data?
Half of this game consists of players completing simple tasks. **WIP**
