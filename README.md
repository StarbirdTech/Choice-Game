# Choice Game

This project teaches society about themselves and democratic governace through a highly inovative and rigorus simulation of random actions. The data generated by the player's actions is then vizualized and can be freely manipulated by applying different voting systems and other elements of real world elections.

## Game Flow
* Do a bunch of random tasks
* See how other people did the tasks
* Apply different voting methods to the data
* See connections between different choices (ex. If you click the red button you are most likely to drag the slider to the left)
